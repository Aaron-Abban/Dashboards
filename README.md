# Dashboards
In this project, I developed a dynamic and interactive dashboard to assess and visualize health facility density across Ghana. The objective was to provide a clear, data-driven overview of the distribution of healthcare services, helping stakeholders identify gaps and areas requiring attention. The project began with the collection and cleaning of datasets from various sources, including government health records and census data. I used Python for data preprocessing and transformation, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

The dashboard was created using Power BI, offering interactive visualizations, including geographic maps that display health facility distribution at both regional and district levels. Key metrics such as facility-to-population ratios, facility types, and trends over time were included to provide a holistic view. The dashboard allows users to filter data by region, type of health facility, and other relevant factors, making it a versatile tool for health planners and policymakers.

By integrating various data sources and visual analytics, this dashboard serves as a critical resource for informed decision-making, enabling the identification of underserved areas and guiding the equitable allocation of healthcare resources across Ghana. The project underscores the importance of data-driven approaches in improving both public and private health infrastructure.
